## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Adam. I'm interested in web development and enjoy learning new technologies and frameworks, especially Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS. I also like working in WordPress and enjoy spending time on CodePen.

- I enjoy staying up to date with ADA accessibility policies as they play a big part in web development.
